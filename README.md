<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this beginner level workshop, we will learn what an API is, what they are used for, and how we can apply them effectively inside our own projects! We will begin by gaining an understanding of what HTTP requests are and how they relate to APIs, and we will then begin experimenting with requests ourselves, using them in python, and finally working towards a mini-project where we connect to the Google Cloud Platform’s Places API to retrieve information about places that we search for!</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<ul>
<li>A python IDE (I personally reccomend PyCharm from JetBrains (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</a>) (If you are a student, you can get all jetbrains products for free!)</li>
<li>The python-pip package manager. This is important because you use it to install third party packages like the “requests” library that we’ll be using in this workshop! If you install PyCharm (above) then this package manager will be installed by default, but otherwise you may have to search for how to install it for your specific IDE, it should be very straightforward.</li>
<li>A Google Cloud Platform account (You can sign up for free, and you will receive $300 credit on your first sign up, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a>)</li>
<li>Stable internet connection (Get on eduroam or UofT if you aren’t already on it)</li>
<li>A very basic knowledge of Git (If not, no worries, I’ll go over what you need during the workshop)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="workshop-structure">Workshop Structure</h1>
<p>The actual content of this workshop is split into different parts, each different part represents a different topic that we will be covering and a different concept that we will learn! Each part is in it’s own git branch!</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to switch branches in git, you can do so with the web interface by clicking the branch button near the top left of the Github window and selecting a branch, the button's text will correspond to the current branch that you're on.<br>

<p>If you’re familiar with git, you can also clone the repo to your local file system using Github Desktop, or by typing <code>git clone https://github.com/Kav-K/RUHacks-API-Workshop</code> and then switch branches with <code>git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;</code></p>
<p>All of the materials you will need for the workshop (except the prerequisites) are all in this repository. In case you get bored of listening to me or have other commitments to attend to during the workshop time slot, you can work on this workshop at home as long as you have this link!</p>
